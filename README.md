# Flash Cards

### Currently under major construction!

> A flash cards app being built with Mongo, Express, Vue, Node

### Why?
The purpose of this project is two-fold:
1. To learn MEVN, as part of becoming a full-stack developer.
2. To be able to create and store flash cards online, as part of my note-taking process in studying CS.  
(I realize I can use Anki, but that defeats the purpose of #1.)
