## Flash Cards

> Flash cards web app designed to aid in study  
> Built mobile-first

### Stack
Front-end: Vue.js  
Back-end: Node.js (express), MongoDB  

### Why?
The purpose of this project is two-fold:
1. To learn MEVN, as part of becoming a full-stack developer.
2. To be able to create and store flash cards online, as part of my note-taking process in studying CS.  
(I realize I can use Anki, but that defeats the purpose of #1.)

### User roles
- Add cards
- View each card (front/back)
- View list of all cards
- Cycle randomly through cards based on tag (General, Code)
- Edit each card
- Mark known/unknown

### Timeline
Project currently under major construction.
